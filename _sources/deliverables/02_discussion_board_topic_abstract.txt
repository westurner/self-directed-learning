I have proposed to write my report on Self-Directed Learning with Online Resources both for students and instructors (because a self-directed student is instructing themself). The report would cover online learning resources like web sites, web applications, and computer-based information resources. More specifically, the report will present Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies through a review and analysis of research and implementations. This is my last required graduation requirement, so I am looking forward to adding some well-reasoned perspective to a lifetime of learning.
