I am requesting your permission to write about Self-Directed Learning
with Online Resources. The report would be a best practices analysis that
would address challenges, opportunities, and strategies by reviewing
implementations of and empirical research regarding online-based instruction.

The report would attempt to align self-directed online education with
national goals for STEM -- Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics -- education.

From the PCAST Engage to Excel Report, February 2012:

PCAST identified five overarching recommendations that it believes
can achieve this goal:
(1) catalyze widespread adoption of empirically validated teaching practices;
(2) advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses
    with discovery-based research courses;
(3) launch a national experiment in postsecondary mathematics education
    to address the mathematics-preparation gap;
(4) encourage partnerships among stakeholders to diversify pathways to
    STEM careers; and
(5) create a Presidential Council on STEM Education with leadership from the
    academic and business communities to provide strategic leadership for
    transformative and sustainable change in STEM undergraduate education.

[Reformatted for readability.]

Specifically, the Self-Directed Learning with Online Resources report
would potentially be within scope of PCAST Engage to Excel recommendations
1-4.

I would welcome any feedback and/or approval regarding this informal
report subject e-mail proposal.
