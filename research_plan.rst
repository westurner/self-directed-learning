Research Plan
==============
Strategy
---------
I would perform research utilizing both secondary and primary research
resources in order to deliver the report on time and on budget.

Secondary Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would utilize internet search engines, academic journals, and 
government reports as secondary research resources.

Search Engines utilized would include Google, Google Scholar, Yahoo, and Bing.

Academic Journals utilized may include any of the journals I found while
searching the UNO Criss library that I have listed in the `Journals`_ 
section of my research log.

Goverment Reports utilized would include the PCAST STEM report and 
Department of Education report entitled 
*Evaluation of Evidence-based Practices in Online Learning*, that I have
cited in my research log.

Primary Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In search of real human perspective from primary sources,
I would conduct interviews of prior and current students from a range of
generations and learning backgrounds.

I would interview:

- An individual from the information technology industry with a perspective
  on lifelong education
- A STEM instructor
- An individual with firsthand experience regarding the
  challenges of traditional STEM education
