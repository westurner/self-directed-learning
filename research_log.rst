I must assume content from the Department of Education (**ed.gov**) 
to be credibly trustworthy. I found this report PDF in the first page of search results and had hoped that trimming the filename from the URL would
redirect to a web page describing the resource. I would guess that
accessibility policy determines the site resolution and font sizes required
of agency web sites. Site search for the PDF title returned the PDF
report as the first result. I like that the search field is placed at
the top of the page, though it could be wider.

The content hosted by **educause.edu** is of superb helpfulness in regards
to my proposed research subject. While it is unfair to judge design from
a netbook, the expansive site header requires scrolling below the fold
to rearch the content of interest. In regards to ease of use, the site
could benefit from more descriptive URLs. Given the .edu URL and
institute listed by the speaker of this particular URL, I would consider
the site trustworthy.

The content hosted by **coursera.org** is of extreme quality.
Instructors at top-tier universities are truly delivering credible
content. The site design is very effective in presenting the courses and course descriptions without extra noise. The use of Twitter bootstrap for
buttons gives the design a familiar look and feel, as well as a simply
usable interface.

        https://www.edx.org/about

The content hosted by **edx.org** is of extreme quality. Instructors at
MIT, Harvard, and UC Berkeley are truly delivering credbile content. The
course descriptions present the most relevant information at first
glance, with a well-designed, easy to use set of graphical icons as well
as video up front.

The content hosted by **ocw.mit.edu** is of extreme quality. Instructors
at MIT have been delivering credible, quality course content and materials for a number of years. While I do appreciate the site design, the fonts could be a little larger for my tastes. The tree of links on the sidebar makes the breadth of content very approachable.
