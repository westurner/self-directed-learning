    Introduction
=============
.. epigraph::

    "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."

    -- Mark Twain


Aquariums and Cave Diving
--------------------------
If self-directed learning with online resources is like cave diving,
traditional classroom-based schooling is like an underwater aquarium
tunnel.


Undergraduate STEM Graduates
-----------------------------
According to the Fact Sheet accompanying the President's Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) February 2012 report entitled
*Engage to Excel: Producing One Million Additional College Graduates With
Degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics* [#1]_:

    "Fewer than 40 percent of students who enter college intending to major
    in a STEM field complete college with a STEM degree today."

More than 60% of students who walk into the traditional classroom-based
aquarium school tunnel turn around and walk out. As an aquarium, this is
a problem.

The PCAST Engage to Excel Report [#1]_ identifies
five overarching recommendations that it believes can achieve the goal of
producing one million additional college graduates with Degrees in
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics::

    (1) catalyze widespread adoption of empirically validated teaching practices;
    (2) advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses
          with discovery-based research courses;
    (3) launch a national experiment in postsecondary mathematics education
          to address the mathematics-preparation gap;
    (4) encourage partnerships among stakeholders to diversify pathways to
          STEM careers; and
    (5) create a Presidential Council on STEM Education with leadership from the
          academic and business communities to provide strategic leadership for
          transformative and sustainable change in STEM undergraduate education.


Goals
------
This report will discuss challenges, opportunities, and strategies
for encouraging self-directed learning with online resources and along the way
will address how students can (1) learn using empirically
validated teaching practices from (2) discovery-based online resources
in order to (3) transform themselves into forward-thinking,
mathematically capable (4) stakeholders in their community.


History
--------
How did we get here?

In the 6th century BC -- around 2600 years ago -- the Greek philosophers
to whom the western world owes much debt did not attend compulsory education.
Abundant resource availability allowed the Greeks to pursue courses of study
and learning through various "schools" of tutorship.
At the time, there were not quite so many students to teach.
In the Peripatetic school, students would walk alongside lecturers like
Aristotle and learn through verbal instruction. Scribes would enscribe
knowledge and wisdom into future-proof stone tablets that persist and
survive to this day.

Through the Middle Ages, master craftsmen would provide food and shelter
to apprentices, or proteges, who learned skilled trades and arts.
Philosophy and science - in the form of alchemy - persisted through the
calligraphy of monastic sects.

Then, in the 19th century CE -- around 200 years ago -- compulsory education
developed in response to newfound abilities to communicate knowledge and
differences of opinion through manually leaded printing presses. [#6]_

The 20th century saw the widespread adoption of advances like telephones,
radios, televisions, and the internet; allowing social sciences to shape
education systems towards mass production modes of standardized
education. An individual with an undergraduate or post-graduate degree
was all but assured a good job.

Now, in the 21st century CE, knowledge creation and assimilation are
accelerating through widespread adoption of online web media technologies
like HTML, digital audio, digital video, and YouTube. Public libraries
are being supplanted by online reference collections and online expert
communities. Educators are continuing to develop and adopt new technologies.

Today, an undergraduate degree is a minimum requirement for, but not a
guarantee of a good job. A STEM degree is nearly a guarantee of a good
job.



Challenges
===========
As indicated by the PCAST Engage to Excel Report [#1]_,
the demand for knowledgeable STEM field careers is greater than the supply.

Too many people are entering the STEM underwater aquarium tunnel,
turning around, and walking out.

There exist primary infrastructure systems that no-one will
know how to maintain.


Resource Constraints
---------------------
This planet suffers from many top-down resource constraints.
More locally, teachers' salaries are low and the costs of learning
materials are high.

Teacher Salaries
+++++++++++++++++
In America today, teachers' salaries are very insubstantial. [#7]_
Teaching assistants' salaries are even less substantial. [#8]_

Learning Materials
+++++++++++++++++++
Learning materials cost time to research, write, and evaluate;
and money to bind and distribute.

Because marginal cost of distribution through an online network is zero,
anyone with a computer and internet connection can publish.

This presents a challenge for students and educators seeking to learn
"true" knowledge and wisdom.


Employer Acceptance
--------------------
Entrepreneurs have been learning and applying self-motivatedly since the
beginning of time.

Employer requirements are driving the growth
in the degree and certification granting institution markets.

Employers are looking for qualified candidates with the capability and
motivation to acquire and apply new skill sets to compete in a
knowledge-driven economy.

While many employers are already leveraging internal online training efforts,
self-directed online learning presents a number of challenges for
employees and employers.

Verification
+++++++++++++
How can a hiring manager be sure that they're getting what they
intend to pay for?

To an employer, a degree indicates that a candidate has the background
knowledge and ability to do the job.

Online degrees and online certifications do not yet hold the status of
university degrees.

This may be because online courses suffer from the same types of
verification problems presented by online polls.

Technical industries are working to solve the verification challenge
by requiring in-person proctored certification exams.

Online learning markets are developing standardized badges [#28]_ and
completion verification letters as corollaries to certificates.


Incentivization
-----------------
From an unofficial interview with a group of Fortune 100 executives,
one response to online learning was "We hire people for advanced
degrees. Why would someone learn online if they aren't going to receive a
degree or credit hours for their efforts?"

From an unofficial interview with a hiring manager at a Fortune 100
technology company, one response to online learning was "Where can I
find people who are demonstrating their desire to continue to stay up to
date within their current or future fields of expertise?"

Both views reflect incentivization challenges for students and employers.

Human Motivation
+++++++++++++++++
"How do we force people to learn?" may be asking the wrong question.

A different question might be:
"How do people learn that learning will improve their lives?"

People want to help themselves and others for various reasons.

Pioneers in positive psychology, such as Abraham Maslow,
indicate that people strive to achieve basic needs like food, water,
and shelter as well as group needs like belongingness and esteem,
and eventually pursue self-actualization.

Both primitive and social survival needs are conditioned and reinforced
by positive and negative experiences.

Primitive needs are conditioned and reinforced with a
"carrot and stick" approach: do this and be gratified with these
rewards: shelter, food, water, healthcare.

Social needs like belongingness and esteem are reinforced by peer
and authority acceptance.

And then there is what some people refer to as a "higher" need for
self-actualization: to achieve mastery for oneself as part of the whole.


Why?
++++
For teachers and STEM professionals who have spent years learning and
pursuing advanced education degrees in order to
do what they want to do, "Why would I want to learn Science, Technology,
Engineering, or Math" may seem like a non-question.

But for a student, the grading structure may be perceived as arbitrary
in relation to their values:
"what does an A in math class have to do with my ability to get the
latest game, shirt, or peer acceptance?."

"We must get good grades in order to get good jobs in order to live
comfortable lives."

Freakonomics [#4]_ addresses one scenario in which students are rewarded for
good grades with money. The authors' findings are inconclusive; they
seem to ask an implicit question: "by adding a component of
instant gratification -- money -- how do
students learn about long-term gratification?".

Different types of people enjoy different things, but you would be
hard-pressed to find a teacher who would respond with anything less than
satisfaction when a student says "I like learning."

From the beginning, self-directed learning requires a lifetime learner
to develop a positive reward-response cycle for themself.


Learning Assessments
---------------------
Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are metrics by which the success of
an operation can be measured. Usually, KPIs are quantitative, empirical
numbers on a scale with a low end and a high end. Usually, KPIs are
scaled to a bell or similar curve. [#9]_

PCAST Recommendation #1.

Self Evaluation
++++++++++++++++
Self evaluation is a primary avenue through which self-directed learners
learn to motivate and evaluate themselves and their level of mastery.

Learning journals in a TIL -- or "Today I Learned" -- format can be
valuable tools for developing a map of progress. [#10]_

Without a guide, a guru, a sensei, or a peer group to support these
evaluations, narcissism may negatively reflect in the student's work.

Nobody cave dives alone.

Instructor Evaluations
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Instructor Evaluation -- or "grading" -- is the traditional method for
evaluating student progress.
Instructor Evaluations can create a dependent relationship that
may or may not be productive in helping self-motivated individuals to
develop skills and strategies for building knowledge.

With personal instructor evaluations, the student learns to depend on
another person as an indicator of their self worth. [#11]_

Some students embrace this positive/negative relationship, while
others sadly reject it -- and school -- altogether.

This is challenge in that the dependent relationship that does not
deliver acceptance may negatively condition the student to dislike
learning, reading, and particular subject areas -- like STEM -- in
general.

Standard-Normal Testing
++++++++++++++++++++++++
While educational institutions and employers have been fond of traditional
Standard-Normal aptitude tests like the ACT and SAT, their applicability
and correlation to skills-acquisition measures have been questioned.
[#12]_

As an internalized metaphor, "leave no-one behind" may indicate a different
intention than "everyone going forward". How do you handle outliers? [#13]_

Voting Choice Theory
++++++++++++++++++++
Voting Choice Theory is the foundation of a democratic system of
government. Voting Choice Theory indicates that a "swarm" of
self-directed individuals drawing from a diverse base of knowledge,
skills, and wisdom is greater than the sum of its parts. [#5]_

While Peer and Community Evaluations may require extra effort, a
sustained connection with a peer group is a good thing.

Community review processes in place at quality journals can be viewed
through the lens of voting choice theory. ibid. ~50% of medical journal
articles are unreproducible ... standardized terminology for
experimental controls ... RDF provenance

PCAST Recommendation #4 [#1]_

Essay Qualification & Quantification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Flesh-Kincaid readability is one of a number of metrics for measuring
prose reports for syllabic complexity. [#14]_ Flesh-Kincaid readability
thresholds are in place for some government agencies and financial
contracts. While automated metrics for essay evaluation may correlate to
syllabic complexity, many automated language metrics fall far short of
measuring actual compositional acuity.

At web-scale, essay quantification through automated metrics are not
sufficient for producing capable communicators. [#15]_

Applied STEM: Computer Science / Engineering
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Computer Science and Engineering are fields where STEM knowledge and
theory are constantly applied.

Efforts at automated design review in the computer science and engineering
fields include Test Driven Development, Automated Model Verification,
and quantitative metrics like cycles required and input/output. [#16]_

Software development concepts like user time and system time can be used
to evaluate design complexity. Design complexity measures
the amount of resources required to achieve specifications. [#17]_

The concept of 'elegance' in design and engineering refers to the
concision with which a design accomplishes design goals. Like essay
evaluation, elegance is very much a subjective measure of mastery.



Opportunities
=================
Self Directed Learning with Online Resources creates value by helping
individuals to develop themselves into self-motivated components of a
greater system. Like any business undertaking, this value can and should
be measured in terms of both direct and indirect returns.


Direct Returns
---------------
The agility afforded by developing an interest in and capability for learning
online creates direct returns for learners in the form of knowledge and skills
acquisition.

An individual or an employee with the desire to learn and better
themselves is an employee that would be hired at many institutions
looking for created, motivated professionals. [#18]_


Indirect Returns / "Externalities"
-----------------------------------
The Indirect Returns of producing Self-Directed Learners may be considered
"externalities" because of the difficulties inherent in a monetary
valuation of a knowledge network.

Network Effects
++++++++++++++++
Metcalf's law is a law from the telecommunications industry that says
that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the
square of the number connected users; which is to say that the network effects
of investing in graphs of knowledge and expertise are exponential.
[#19]_

Goodwill
+++++++++
The goodwill created in the market by altruistic participants is
difficult to quantify. Anecdotally, I am forever indebted to the
professors and institutions that have offered their knowledge and wisdom
for free. [#20]_

Knowledge Economy
++++++++++++++++++
More self-directed learners learning more on their own leads to more
talent creating more more creative applications of technology and ever more
value-creating efficient, sustainable business plans.



Strategies
===========
Channels
---------
Static Documents
+++++++++++++++++
Static documents are traditional textual products like Books and Readings.

Video
++++++
Online video is a very engaging market for knowledge delivery. [#21]_ Most
online course offerings include video lectures as a primary component.
[#2]_

Q&A : Question and Answer Forums
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Question and answer forums in the style of http://StackExchange.com allow
class sizes to reach web scale with hundreds or thousands of people in a
course. This is a new take on the Socractic method of dialectical
reasoning. Experts are ranked by the swarm. [#22]_

Chat : Realtime Web Chat
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Realtime web chat allows users in the same time frame to interact one-
to-one or one-to-many in a peer based fashion.


Implementations
------------------
[#2]_

OpenCourseware, Coursera, EdX
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
While people had been sharing information online for many years,
OpenCourseware - largely supported by MIT - is a leading example of
sharing curriculum and instruction materials in a structured format. [#23]_

Free online learning providers like Coursera [#24]_ and EdX [#25]_
offer instructional materials, course-based learning communities,
and online learning assessments.

University Online Offerings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Most colleges and universities are offering at least a few online
classes. [#2]_

Comparison Scheme for Collaborative Technology
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
**Groupware: Design, Implementation, and Use** [#3]_ by Briggs, et.al,
presented in the month of September of the year 2008 in Omaha, NE,
presents a scheme for comparing collaboration technology solutions.

Lab Exercises
--------------
PCAST Recommendations #2, #3 [#1]_

CodeCademy
+++++++++++
As a model for online lab-based learning, CodeCademy offers lab-style learning
tracks focusing on various programming skills with automated grading. [#26]_

Math-based web game design
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It is possible to teach multiple competencies through project-based
learning. For example, students could create a client-side web-based game
in HTML5 and Javascript where points are scored by completing the square
of a triangle.
