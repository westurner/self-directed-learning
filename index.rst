Report Subject
==============
Self-Directed Learning with Online Resources

Subject
-------
I formally request your permission to write about Self-Directed Learning
with Online Resources. The report would address challenges, opportunities,
and strategies for learning online by reviewing implementations of and
empirical research regarding online-based instruction.

According to the Fact Sheet accompanying the President's Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) February 2012 report entitled
*Engage to Excel: Producing One Million Additional College Graduates With
Degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics*:

    Fewer than 40 percent of students who enter college intending to major 
    in a STEM field complete college with a STEM degree today.

The PCAST STEM Report proposes four policy recommendations for
increasing the retention rate and thereby producing one million
additional college graduates with degrees in STEM fields.

    (1) catalyze widespread adoption of empirically validated teaching practices;
    (2) advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses
        with discovery-based research courses;
    (3) launch a national experiment in postsecondary mathematics education
        to address the mathematics-preparation gap;
    (4) encourage partnerships among stakeholders to diversify pathways to
        STEM careers; and
    (5) create a Presidential Council on STEM Education with leadership from the
        academic and business communities to provide strategic leadership for
        transformative and sustainable change in STEM undergraduate education.

The report would address how students can (1) learn using empirically
validated teaching practices from (2) discovery-based online resources
in order to (3) transform themselves into foward-thinking,
mathematically capable (4) stakeholders in their community.


Terms
~~~~~~
:Self-directed:
    Control of and responsibility for how, what, and when

:Online Resources:

Purpose
--------
The report's purpose would be twofold:

1. Help lifelong learners acquire valuable skills by learning to learn
   with online resources.
2. Provide perspective for instructors interested in adapting and
   leveraging online resources.

Scope
------
The report would address challenges, opportunites, and strategies for 
reaping returns from online resources.

 - Challenges
 - Opportunities
 - Strategies

Personal Experience
--------------------
The interwebs have allowed me to acquire knowledge, skills, and wisdom
on my own. Through the generosity and attention-seeking of online
resource creators, I have learned to:

- Create Websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Write code in Various Programming Languages
- Edit Video
- Interpret Stories
- Pass Math Class

I would like to give back.

Challenges
-----------
With self-directed learning, the relation between student and instructor
may be less defined. Self-motivated learning and exploration require
students to assume some of the roles that a formalized instructor
fulfills.

It may be difficult to address our Prussian tendencies in relation to
both creativity and the achievement gap.
