::

   SPARQL SELECT query

Bibliographic Citations
========================
Maintaining structured links to reference and documentation sources

* Document title
* Page Number
* #URL Fragment
* Attachment Revisions

Opportunity: Smart Tagging
============================
Collaboratively linked ontologies for augmenting sequence authors

Document Capturing Process
============================
.. epigraph:: Wait? What? You want to scan this? Awesome.

*Artifacts*

* Why tag things?
* Why name them?
* Why label them?


Finding and Disambiguating Concept & Entity Identifiers
=========================================================
Cognitive Ontological Knowledge Graph

* Concept Trees
* Concept Vines

* Namespace Prefixes
* Typed Links/Edges
* :term:`RDF` /
  :term:`OWL` /
  :term:`SPARQL` /
  :term:`JSON`

.. epigraph:: How do our fields link together? What do they call a _____ ?

Designing URIs for Resource Collections
=========================================
.. epigraph:: What page number was that? If this was a web page, I could
   just __________?

* Which page is it on?
* What is the :term:`URL` ?
* Why doesn't this :term:`PDF`
  :term:`Bookmark`
  include the document title?
* This page does not include content mentioning these keywords.
* Can I link to a document subsection with a :term:`URL Fragment`?
* How should I organize course files for a zip archive?
* How should I organize course files for packaging?
* How do I watch/listen to course lectures on a phone, tablet, TV, mac, pc?
* How can I adjust the font?
* Where should the :term:`presentation`
  mix with the :term:`Content`?
* "Data not available"
* How do I search based on :term:`metadata`?

  * Faceting

Distinction between Cognitive References
=========================================
* *Concept*: ``Bookmark``
* *Instance*: ``bookmarks/{id}``::

   { 'ID': ID,
     'isA': Bookmark,
     'url':URL,
     'title': TITLE }

* *User Instance*: ``bookmarks/{username}/{id}``

.. note:: Nodes and edges with activities whereupon potentiation
   potentiates with behaviors determined by namespaced attributes

Bibliography List Metadata
=============================
.. epigraph:: Is this a permalink? Is there a shorturl?

RDFa

[TODO:cite]

Unique Identifiers
-------------------
* DOI, ISBN, URL

* How should I link to a table?
* Can we archive these links at compile time?
* Would we draw the same conclusions?
* Repeatability

Bibliographies: Footnote Citation Management
===============================================
Footnote *naming* simplifies reference lookup.

Manually maintaining serially ordered citation lists seems excessively
tedious. Name them and assign numbers later?

[TODO:cite]

Resources: Course Lifecycle
=============================

   but it/I ________ <would/should/could>
   _________________,
   which would save __________ <amount of time>.

.. note:: Eliciting Value Criteria Matrices
   
Resources: Opportunities: Resource Short URLs
==============================================
Convenient globally non-unique hashed identifiers.

Maintaining Bibliographic citations with BibTeX

Managing citations as structured data with a plain text lightweight
markup format.

.. note:: sphinxcontrib-bibtex + Zotero BibTeX export + naming
   convention

Authoring: Generating Curricula Activity Graphs
=================================================
As knowledge graph traversals that fit degree and resource constraints.

Sequenced graph traversals with boundary-contextual transitions

::

   MindMap to Paper

   If I am creating a linearly sequenced book, I am essentially creating a
   depth first search/walk of an ordered graph of document sections with
   hopefully compile-time checking for links and references
   hyperlinked within and between documents with markup.

Authoring: Sequencing Learning Objects
========================================
For & Against Task/Skill Dependency Models
