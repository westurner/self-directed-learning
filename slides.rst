Curriculum Interfaces
=======================
.. epigraph:: would be great if I could schedule sliding windows of
   content sequences with expected exercise durations.

A Curriculum Sequence
=====================
1. Read **A1 Reading**
      Consume :term:`document` :term:`resource`
2. Watch **A1 Video: Lecture 1**
   Consume :term:`resource`
3. Answer **A1 Quiz Questions**
   Check for comprehension.
4. Apply **A1 Project**
      Apply and synthesize.

*Comprehension testing*, *Peer-reviewed annotations*

Sequencing Tagged Resources
============================
.. epigraph:: "Twist until it feels correct."

:term:`Learning Objects` and
:term:`Learning Resources`
into :term:`sequences <sequencing>`.

Paths of :term:`Learning Objects <Learning Object>`

Paths build upon themselves

Encoding domain wisdom into :term:`sequences <sequencing>`





Authoring: Generating Curricula Activity Graphs
=================================================
As knowledge graph traversals that fit degree and resource constraints.

Sequenced graph traversals with boundary-contextual transitions


Process Component Competency Graph


Curriculum/Degree Sequence Requirements
=========================================
.. epigraph:: What is the path to the file?

Describing learning areas

* Goals
* Modules
* Assessments
* Prerequisites as implied paths/sequences

Describing **Learning Momentum** with 
stratified **skills objectives**

Measuring for :term:`Ability`,
:term:`Proficiency`,
and :term:`Aptitude`


URI-linked resources and reasonable concepts in a 
linked open data cloud.

Modular interface specifications
with prerequisite knowledge
linked as part of a traversal
through a greater knowledge graph.

:term:`Graphs <graph>` and subgraphs of
:term:`Learning Resources <Learning Resource>`
with :term:`URIs <URI>` according to
domain-relevant :term:`ontologies <ontology>`.

Reviewing Curriculum Sequences
===============================
.. epigraph:: Is there a book?

Sharing Revisions and Annotations

* Revisions: Corrections, Extensions
* Notes/Comments
* Feature presence and fitness ratings
* Comparing Citations

.. note:: :term:`ReStructuredText` + :term:`GIFT` + :term:`OEMBED`

Authoring: Curricula Management
=================================
So we have standardized curricula which can be delivered 
through multiple channels.

* How do I add/modify this?
* How do we share challenges & opportunities?
* How can we compare similarities and differences?

Distributed Revision Control

* Peer Revision Control
* Local Forks, Branches
* Pull Requests, Patches





Learning Metrics
=================
.. epigraph:: "Is it the course or the student?"

* Curriculum Goal Sets
* :term:`Optmization <optimizing>`
* Conceptual Routing Algorithms




Software R&D and Learning
--------------------------
.. note:: clearly, what is being learned is that analysis of structured
   data interchange in regards to optimizing for outcomes

Learning Comes from a diverse background

.. note:: it would follow that software development learning best
   practices are inherent and implicit to best practices for software
   development process control

**Process Wisdom**

the software is the person is not the curriculum

Project Based Learning
========================
.. note:: So, okay, well these assignments look great but we're going to
   work on developing projects so that we can focus on
   specialization and synthesis of TODO

* How should we measure success?
* Which feature scores correlate with success?
* Learning Scientific, Creative and Collaborative Processes





Augmenting Learning
=====================
.. epigraph:: "Here's a library, knock yourself out"

Simplest, least complex approach
Accelerating and Augmenting Learning


:ref:`Englebart 1964`



Standard Project Documents
============================
