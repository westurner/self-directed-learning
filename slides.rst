   content sequences with expected exercise durations.

A Curriculum Sequence
=====================

      Consume :term:`document` :term:`resource`
2. Watch **A1 Video: Lecture 1**
   Consume :term:`resource`
3. Answer **A1 Quiz Questions**
   Check for comprehension.
4. Apply **A1 Project**
      Apply and synthesize.

*Comprehension testing*, *Peer-reviewed annotations*

Sequencing Tagged Resources
============================

:term:`Learning Objects` and
:term:`Learning Resources`
into :term:`sequences <sequencing>`.

   practices are inherent and implicit to best practices for software
   development process control

**Process Wisdom**

the software is the person is not the curriculum

Project Based Learning
========================
.. note:: So, okay, well these assignments look great but we're going to
   work on developing projects so that we can focus on
   specialization and synthesis of TODO
